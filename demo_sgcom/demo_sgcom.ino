 * This file orchestrates the sdcard_gps_compass_odometer_mobility demo.
 * When the start/stop button is pressed, the robot will drive forward for a
 * predetermined amount of time and then stop. While it is moving, GPS data,
 * compass data, odometer data are continuosly stored to the statevars variable.
 * And the statevars are continuously written to a file on the SD card.
 *
 * The program ends when the robot stops moving.
